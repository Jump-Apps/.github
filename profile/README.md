#Jump Apps - building apps that last.

Hi! My name is Tim Kumpat. I'm a 17 year old founder and software engineer from germany. I started Jump Apps and it's just me. 

With Jump Apps, it's my goal to build apps that last. This means they are designed to improve the life of a user for a long time and have a purpose.
One thing I'm doing to achieve that goal is that I'm prioritizing quality over quantity. Thus I will only ship products when I know I did the best I could.

I'm currently building the first app. To stay updated on that you can check out the [Jump Apps](https://www.linkedin.com/company/jump-apps/) or [Tim Kumpat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timkumpat/) LinkedIn account.

On this GitHub page I will publish projects related to Jump Apps. If you're interested in my personal projects, you can check out the [Tim-Kumpat](https://github.com/Tim-Kumpat) GitHub page

If you have any further question, feel free to reach out.
